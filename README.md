# Explaination

HTML Structure:
Create an HTML structure for the homepage that includes a section for the featured product carousel. Each product item in the carousel should have its own HTML container with relevant information.

CSS Styling:
Apply CSS styling to ensure the responsiveness and visual appeal of the carousel. Use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. Focus on a clean and user-friendly design to enhance the shopping experience.

JavaScript for Carousel:
Use JavaScript to implement the product carousel. For automatic image sliding and manual navigation, consider using a lightweight carousel library like Slick Carousel or Glide.js. These libraries provide easy integration and customization.

Product Page:
Create a dedicated product page (e.g., for One Plus Nord 2) using HTML and CSS. Include relevant details such as product images, descriptions, and specifications. Enhance the page with JavaScript for additional interactions if needed.

Display Image Changer:
If the "Display Image Changer" refers to a feature within the product page, implement this using JavaScript. For example, use event listeners to switch displayed images based on user interactions.

Slick Carousel:
Slick Carousel was chosen for its ease of use, responsive design, and customizable features. It simplifies the implementation of a feature-rich product carousel.

Responsive Design:
Media queries and responsive design principles are incorporated to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
